# Java 21 Main features samples 


## 1. Pattern Matching for switch

This feature extends the capabilities of switch expressions and statements, allowing you to express more complex and sophisticated data pattern matching

```java
public static String describeShape(Object shape) {
    return switch (shape) {
        case Circle c    -> "Circle with radius " + c.getRadius();
        case Rectangle r -> "Rectangle with width " + r.getWidth() + " and height " + r.getHeight();
        case null        -> "It's null"; 
        default          -> "Some other shape"; 
    };
}
```

Pattern matching in switch can be combined with '**guards**' (additional boolean conditions) to refine matching criteria

```java
enum TrafficLight { RED, YELLOW, GREEN }

String handleMessage(TrafficLight light) {
    return switch (light) {
        case RED     -> "Stop!";
        case YELLOW  -> "Prepare to stop";
        case GREEN   -> "Go!";
        default      -> "Unknown signal"; // Should rarely happen
    };
}
```

Pattern matching offers powerful data extraction mechanisms in switch expressions and statements

```java
record Rectangle(int width, int height) {}
record Circle(int radius) {}
record Triangle(int base, int height) {}

String calculateArea(Shape shape) {
    return switch (shape) {
        case Rectangle(int w, int h) -> "Rectangle area: " + (w * h);
        case Circle(int r)           -> "Circle area: " + (Math.PI * r * r);
        case Triangle(int b, int h)  -> "Triangle area: " + (0.5 * b * h);
        default                      -> "Unsupported shape";
    };
}
```

Let's craft a **more complex example** to demonstrate the expressive power of **pattern matching in switch within Java 21**

**Scenario: Parsing Geometric Shapes**

Suppose we have geometric shapes represented with a hierarchy of sealed classes and records:

```java
sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, ComplexShape {}

record Circle(double radius) implements Shape {}
record Rectangle(double width, double height) implements Shape {}
record Triangle(double base, double height) implements Shape {}
record ComplexShape(List<Shape> subShapes) implements Shape {}
```

**Goal: Calculate the combined area of shapes with intricate structures**:

```java
public static double calculateTotalArea(Shape shape) {
    return switch (shape) {
        case Circle(double radius) -> Math.PI * radius * radius;
        case Rectangle(double width, double height) -> width * height;
        case Triangle(double base, double height) -> 0.5 * base * height;
        case ComplexShape(List<Shape> subShapes) -> 
            subShapes.stream()
                     .mapToDouble(ShapeUtils::calculateTotalArea) // Recursive call
                     .sum();
        default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown shape type");
    };
}
```

**Key Points**

**Sealed Hierarchy**: The sealed keyword ensures all possible shape types are known (enhancing pattern matching safety).

**Type Patterns**: We match against specific types (Circle, Rectangle, etc.)

**Record Patterns**: Deconstruct records instantly to extract components (radius, width, height).

**Nested Patterns**: The ComplexShape case shows how patterns can be nested to handle recursive structures.

**Guarded Patterns**: We could add guards to patterns (e.g., case Triangle(double base, double height) when base > 0) for even finer-grained matching.
